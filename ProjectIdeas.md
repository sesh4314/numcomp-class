    * [PETSc](https://mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)
    * [Elemental](http://libelemental.org/)
  * Noisy functions
  * Discontinuous or non-smooth functions
  * Mix of discrete and continuous variables
  * Adaptive approximations
  * Approximation in high dimensions
  * Regression without the standard assumptions (see notebook)
  * Fast transforms (FFT and Chebyshev interpolation)
  * Minimax/Chebyshev approximation (like "max-norm regression")
  * Integration in high dimensions
    * Monte Carlo methods (randomized)
  * Randomized matrix approximation
  * Boundary value problems
  * Data assimilation (e.g., Kalman filtering)
